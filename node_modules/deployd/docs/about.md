# About Deployd

We call Deployd a **resource server**. A resource server is not a library, but a complete server that works out of the box, and can be customized to fit the needs of your app by adding resources. Resources are ready-made components that live at a URL and provide functionality to your client app.

An example of a resource is a data collection. You only have to define the properties and types of objects, and the server will validate the data. You will also be able to create your own custom resources and install custom resources from other developers. (we're built on Node.js, so custom resources will take the form of node modules).
